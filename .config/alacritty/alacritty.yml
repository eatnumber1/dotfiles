# Alacritty appears to process imports before local files, which means that
# local overrides to globals would not work if this were the global config
# file.  With this file, we explicitly import the global and then the local
# config files.
import:
  # Import the global config first
  - "~/.config/alacritty/global.yml"

  # Windows-specific global config (overrides some of the global config)
  - "~/.config/alacritty/windows-global.yml"

  # Import the local config
  - "~/.config/alacritty/local.yml"
